# Advent of Code 2024 - Python

Welcome to the repository containing my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges!   
The solutions are written in Python and are structured to be easy to understand and run.  
Part two is usually 'enabled' via a CLI flag.

## Overview

Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve two programming puzzles each day, from December 1st to December 25th.   
The puzzles range from simple to complex and cover a variety of topics.

The solutions are written in Python and utilize(try to) modern Python features (cos I missed using these :D) such as:
- assignment expressions
- pattern matching (match and case statements)
- dictionary merge (|) and update (|=) operators
- variadic generics? (maybe)
